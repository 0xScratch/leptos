# `projects` README

The `projects` directory is intended as a collective of medium-to-large-scale examples: a place to show a variety of use cases and integrations between Leptos and other libraries. Over time, our hope is that this allows us to showcase a wider variety of user examples, without the main `examples` directory becoming too overwhelming to be useful.

The `examples` directory is included in our CI, and examples are regularly linted and tested. The barrier to entry for the `projects` directory is intended to be lower: Example projects will generally be built against a particular version, and not regularly linted or updated. Hopefully this distinction allows us to accept more examples without worrying about the maintenance burden of constant updates.

Feel free to submit projects to this directory via PR!
